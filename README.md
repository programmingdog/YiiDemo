## Specifications

1. Implement a simple Supplier List Page (View/Update/Delete are **NOT** needed) by using Yii's super powerful **GridView** widget.
2. Supplier structure looks like the below and please mock some random data by yourself.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE `supplier` (
  `id` int unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(50) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `code` char(3) CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_general_ci DEFAULT NULL,
  `t_status` enum('ok','hold') CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_general_ci NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ok',
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `uk_code` (`code`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_general_ci;
```
3. A user can **filter** suppliers ...
    1. id - support:
        1. >10 - match all id greater than 10
        2. also support: <10, >=10, <=10, ...
    1. name and code - support partial matching
    2. t_status - a dropdown including all and each status
1. A user can **multi-select** suppliers, and of course, will have a convenient way to **select all** suppliers on the current page.
2. If a user selects all rows, he will be prompted and have a way to select all filtered rows **across all pages** and cancel. The following UX is for your reference. You can do it in your own way.

1. After having rows selected, the user can click an "Export" button to download all selected rows as a CSV file.
    1. The user will be asked (could be a modal or a single page): Which column(s) to be included in the CSV and column "id" is mandatory.
    2. And of course, this should correctly handle the "select across all pages" situation.

# Requirements

1. Please understand a code challenge is for letting us know your skills. Do **NOT** submit your code if you are not taking it seriously. Please pay attention to details, boundary data, and exceptions.
2. Use Yii's built-in or official extensions. Do **NOT** use other 3rd party components, like kartik/gridview.
3. Submit your code to github (You can create a new account if you don't want to mix it with your primary account.) Do **NOT** use other non-github platforms, like gitee.
4. Better if you could provide the link to a live demo of your code and have some reasonable data populated.
